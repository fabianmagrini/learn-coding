## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

- **`python/csv-hasher/`**: This directory contains a Python command-line tool for CSV file manipulation.
    - **`hashify.py`**: This script is a command-line utility that takes a CSV file as input, hashes a specified column using a chosen hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA256, MD5), and outputs a new CSV file with the hashed column. This is useful for anonymizing or creating unique identifiers for data in CSV files while preserving the structure.
